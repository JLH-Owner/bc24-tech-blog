# Tech Blog using MVC

## Description
This Blog is designed to manage posts using the model, view, controller paradigm. We use sequelize for the models and express APIs. The views are developed using express-handlebars. We add bcrypt for authentication as well as connect-session-sequelize, and express-session to store user data.
